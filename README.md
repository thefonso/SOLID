A few weeks ago I fininished reading about the SOLID principles in Uncle Bob's Agile Software Development text. I mentioned this to Doug, my mentor,
Who then smiled at me and said. Then you are ready to teach me these principles? So at the end of this week (Jan 11th) I will be teaching my mentor the SOLID principles
So come with me on a little journey as I do my reveiw and learn a bit about the SOLID principles.

Let's start with some definitions.

SOLID:

- [SRP - Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_SRP.md) 	- Every class (and method within) should be responsible for one thing and one thing only.
- [OCP - Open Closed Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_OCP.md) 			- Open for extension, but closed for modification..[think Firefox]
- [LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_LSP.md) 	- Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- [ISP - Interface Substitution Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_ISP.md) 	- Don't depend on things you don't need
- [DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_DIP.md) 	- High-level policy should not depend on low-level detail. Low-level detail should depend on high-level policy.
										  
										  

Now, each post following this one will explore one of these principles....On to the first one, [The Single Responsibility Principle](https://github.com/thefonso/SOLID/blob/master/solid_SRP.md).
